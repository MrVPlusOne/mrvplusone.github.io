I am a research scientist at [Augment Computing, Inc.](https://augmentcode.com) I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science at UT Austin, advised by [Işıl Dillig](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/) and [Greg Durrett](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/). My PhD research focuses on combining deep learning and static analysis to automate programming tasks such as type inference and code autoediting. During my first few years as a PhD student, I also explored a range of other research topics, including software security and verification, program synthesis, and robotics. Before joining UT, I received my bachelor’s degree in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China.
