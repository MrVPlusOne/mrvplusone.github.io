I'm a founding member and research scientist at [Augment Computing, Inc.](https://augmentcode.com/), where I build innovative AI-powered developer tools. I earned my PhD in Computer Science from UT Austin under the guidance of [Işıl Dillig](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~isil/) and [Greg Durrett](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/), focusing on blending deep learning with static analysis to automate programming tasks like type inference and code autoediting. Along the way, I also gained experience in software security, verification, program synthesis, and robotics. Before UT, I earned my bachelor’s in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China.

At Augment, I've worked on projects ranging from code completion to retrieval context, and I'm currently leading our research on the [Next Edit feature](https://www.augmentcode.com/#Edits). I’m passionate about building tools that empower developers, and I thrive on tackling complex AI challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible in software engineering with large language models.
